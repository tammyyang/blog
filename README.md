# Tammy's Blog

This is Tammy's **personal** blog. 

If you are looking for community support or have encountered any issues related to Numbers Protocol, please visit [commumity sopport](https://github.com/numbersprotocol/community-support) repository, leave comments or open issues there.

Since it is a personal blog, I will run it in my own way:

1. You are welcome to leave your comments, but I may not respond to you
2. I may delete comments that I don't feel comfortable with 
3. The blog may be closed any time based on my own interests
